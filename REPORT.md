#### Introduction
Our application runs on android devices, and it allows users to learn the services offered by nearby 
walk-in clinics and for users to book appointments at a specific clinic of their choice. The 
application shows a user the expected waiting time for a walkin-in clinic. This wait time is 
calculated based on the number of pateients waiting to be seen, and assuming each patient takes 15 
minutes for their appointemnt. The app functions based on the needs of three types of users the 
administrator, the walk-in clinics employees, and the patients. 

As the administrator, a user can manage all possible services that can be offered to patients. The 
administrator will be able to create at least 5 services to be offered by walk-in clinics. They can 
see all registered users so they inactivate a specific user's account or the account of a walk-in 
clinic. 

As a walk-in clinic employee, users can create profiles for clinics and then select the services 
offered by that clinic and its working hours. Employees can create account for walk-in clinic, select 
services provided by the walk-in clinic and the roles of the people performing the service

As a patients, users can search for walk-in clinics by their address or by the services the clinics 
provide or by the working hours a walk-in clinics opperates during. Patients can create an account 
and then search for walk-in clinics by address or the type of service provided or the working hours 
of clinics. Patients will be able to check into clinic and book appointment with a clinic, and they 
can also rate their experience at each walk-in clinic.

#### Lessons Learned 
We learned many new skills by completing this project. Collaborating on code through GitHub, we were able to gain essential experience with the tool. Connecting our app to a database (Firebase) was essential in order to tailor information that each user sees when logging in. Through the completion of this app, we were able to gain experience putting our ability to code in Java to use.
